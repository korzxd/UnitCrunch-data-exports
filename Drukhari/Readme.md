# Drukhari Index v1.0
## General Information
* This Index contains all units from the current `Index: Drukhari`
  
* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield, they include their **`Leader`** ability but this should be left inactive unless simulating that effect.
  
* All unit profiles that have a squad size have been created at their minimum size and the following datasheets have alternate sizes as a separate profile:
    - Talos (x1, x2)
    - Kabalite Warriors (x10, x5 special weapons, x5 splinter rifles)
  
* Some bodyguard + leader combinations are included:
    - Court of the Archon + Archon
    - Incubi x5 + Drazhar
    - Kabalite Warriors x10 + Archon
    - Wracks x5 + Haemonculus
    - Wyches x10 + Lelith Hesperax
    - Wyches x10 + Succubus
  
* All units that have the `Damaged: 1-X Wounds Remaining` ability have a `-1 to hit roll (if attacker)` ability in their unit profile that can be enabled.
  
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.
  
* Some Units have Abilities in the form of a Weapon Profile these will have `- (Ability)` at the end of their weapon name.\
