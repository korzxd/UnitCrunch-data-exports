# Adeptus Custodes Index v1.1
## General Information

* This Index contains all units from the current `Codex: Adeptus Custodes` and the `Imperial Armour: Adeptus Custodes`.
  
* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield, they include their **`Leader`** ability but this should only be used in an **Advanced Profile**. (Refer to [Mixing_Profiles.md](/Guides/Mixing_Profiles.md))
  
* All unit profiles that have a squad size have been created at their **Minimum** size unless stated otherwise.
  
* All unit profile weapons have the default maximum `Count per unit` for that squad size.
  
* All units that have the `Damaged: 1-X Wounds Remaining` ability have a `-1 to hit roll (if attacker)` ability in their unit profile that can be enabled.
  
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.
  
* Some Units have Abilities in the form of a Weapon Profile these will have `- (Ability)` at the end of their weapon name.

* Make sure to enable/disable the **Global Modifiers** to match your detachment conditions. This will prevent any inaccuracies.
