# Leagues of Votann v1.0
## General Information

* This Index contains all units from the current `Index: Leagues of Votann`.
  
* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield, they include their **`Leader`** ability but this should be left inactive unless simulating that effect.

* All unit profiles that have a **`Leader`** attatched use the "<unit_name> led by <unit_name>" format
  
* All unit profiles that have a variable squad size have the size indicated within parentheses.
  
* All unit profile weapons have the default maximum `Count per unit` for that squad size.
  
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.
  
* Some Units have Abilities in the form of a Weapon Profile these will have `- (Ability)` at the end of their weapon name.
