# Black Templar Index v1.0
## General Information
* **Excluded Legends:**  
* **`Leaders`** are all separate unit profiles acting as if they were a sole unit on the battlefield, they include their **`Leader`** ability but this should only be used in an **Advanced Profile**. (Refer to [Mixing_Profiles.md](/Guides/Mixing_Profiles.md)) (See exceptions below)
* All unit profile weapons have the default maximum `Count per unit`.
* All units that have the `Damaged: 1-X Wounds Remaining` ability have a `-1 to hit roll` ability in their unit profile that can be enabled.
* All unit profiles have the weapons shown on their datasheet unless specified.
